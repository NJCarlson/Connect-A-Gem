# Connect-A-Gem!
 A 2D Matching Puzzle Game! Can you get a high score!?

# Notes:

- The grid of gems is randomly generated! 

- There are 3 difficulty levels in the game, levels 2 and 3 each add another color of gem to the grid, making it more difficult to spot matches! If I had more time I would improve upon this, by adding more gems, including power ups that add to the time and multiply the player’s score.

- One of the most interesting parts of developing this game was implementing a depth first search to check if the grid had any remaining matches. When no matches are left the board is wiped, and regenerated so the player can keep going!

- The leaderboard uses JSON and Unity PlayerPrefs to save the player’s name, score, and date.
